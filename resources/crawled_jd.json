BenchSci s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 24,000 scientists at more than 2,000 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.Tenacity: What we re trying to do isn t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed.
